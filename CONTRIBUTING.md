You know how to clone a project, right? In case you simply want to run it, here it is:

`git clone https://github.com/FlyingSaturn/yawcalc-web.git`

I personally recommend using SSH instead of HTTPS for cloning. But in case you're just starting out, there's no need to do that. Just ensure that your name and email in the Git configs (local or global) are actually the one you want to reveal to the world.

# Running the project

Just open index.html in a web browser to run it.
